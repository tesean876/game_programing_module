# Learning Journal
7-14th October
For the past weeks I have been following along with the lesson with the help of Leo but will not deny that I have been distracted and not sure how to engage with the lesson, I do follow along with git hub sign up and reading through the vle but I am still confused at times with not much ways to open up and say I am struggling.
21st October
In the lesson we are trying to learn and pick a component that we will be using in our module which I have put my foot in my mouth and say to do movement whether it be 3D or 2D I am not so sure but long as I find a decent tutorial make it crystal clear to Paul I am not so confident in my abilities in coding and just trying to make the most decent showing of my skills but at this point I am just overwhelmed more then before.
I tried to use

as a way of being able to code but turned out anything but success, having been helped by Oba I was able to use this site in order to learn how to script it properly.

but I have still come to the realisation that I am. In so desperate need to understand coding as it is a headache inducing task with lots to learn.
Oba also suggest me to learn https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php which would help and that I got the bombshell from paul of THERE BEING SPECIAL NEEDS ASSISTANTS AVAILABLE FOR NOTE MAKING THIS WHOLE TIME AND I DIDN’T KNOW ABOUT IT
