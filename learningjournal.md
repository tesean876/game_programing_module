# Learning Journal
## 7-14th October

For the past weeks I have been following along with the lesson with the help of Leo but will not deny that I have been distracted and not sure how to engage with the lesson, I do follow along with git hub sign up and reading through the vle but I am still confused at times with not much ways to open up and say I am struggling.

## 21st October

In the lesson we are trying to learn and pick a component that we will be using in our module which I have put my foot in my mouth and say to do movement whether it be 3D or 2D I am not so sure but long as I find a decent tutorial make it crystal clear to Paul I am not so confident in my abilities in coding and just trying to make the most decent showing of my skills but at this point I am just overwhelmed more then before.
I tried to use

as a way of being able to code but turned out anything but success, having been helped by Oba I was able to use this site in order to learn how to script it properly.
https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.2/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform.Translate.html
but I have still come to the realisation that I am. In so desperate need to understand coding as it is a headache inducing task with lots to learn.
Oba also suggest me to learn https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php which would help and that I got the bombshell from paul of THERE BEING SPECIAL NEEDS ASSISTANTS AVAILABLE FOR NOTE MAKING THIS WHOLE TIME AND I DIDN’T KNOW ABOUT IT

Mentally here.

## 28th October to 25th November

This whole time whilst I have been in lessons I have not actually sat and done anything. Partially because of procrastination and mainly because of other modules taking up most of my time and energy, so while I been trying to understand it I just seemingly can’t get the hang of it. 

## December 2nd and 3rd 

I had now started working on more for the module and ended up learning from Alexander that I can do an enemy animation cycle and despite the hiccup of accidentally deleting my movement script I will soon get it fixed while looking at the tutorials Leo has given me to use

## December 9th

Currently bouncing between module works but am trying to catch up with work that I have fallen behind on because of the nightmare that was 3D modelling. Even making sure to journal my struggles. We had been able to figure out a tutorial that can help make a timer script and despite the issue of not knowing why the time manager was not working I was able to get a head start. Not only that but was able to figure out how to do a movement script and despite the issue of gravity knocking it over I was able to get it locked into place so it does not tip over, but only now I must focus on making sure I put more work into this.

# Spiritually how I feel dealing with everything at this precise moment.

## December 16th

Was able to finally get the script of the timer working and was able to get it displayed on screen, it was due to me not attaching the script in the timer manager canvas which resulted in it just being blank.
Going backwards I did also learnt that I had to separate each component and did learn I can drag scripts and animations from one project to another, first was the movement script, Then enemy which was much more trickier but figured out, then started working on the 4th and final component.
## December 17th - 18th 
the 4th and final component was decided to be collectible that destroys itself when in contact with the player, now even though that I had struggled with being able to get the code to work I had discovered that it was the player script I needed to alter in order to destroy said object, I then was able to duplicate it and send it around the map which proved successful make it work

## December 19th 

After being able to replicate it into my main project I was able to get everything under one roof, with every component done I can finally focus on other modules and record myself and properly write everything down.

## 23rd December 

I am now fully updating my journal and making sure that everything is properly working in order to upload everything.
